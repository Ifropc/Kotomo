Kotomo is a Kotlin library for identifying Japanese characters from images.  
Kotomo was originally a fork of Kanjitomo-orc and uses the same algorithm, developed by Sakari Kääriäinen.

Kotomo is work in progress with the end goal to release a multiplatform library (targeting mainly JVM and JS) 
as well as browser extension, using the library.
